# TensorFlow-Distributed-Deep-Learning
Benchmarking exercise of distributed computing strategies using the MNIST data and convolutional neural networks.

Note that as of 11 Jan. 2020, the distributed computing strategies in TensorFlow 2 have in part experimental support. Changes to the code might therefore be necessary for future implementation. 

2020, Jakob Everding and Kevin Koch.
